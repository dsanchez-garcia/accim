The `MeterReader` class takes the arguments `key_name`, `frequency`, `name` and `func`, while `VariableReader` class takes the arguments  `key_value`, `variable_name`, `frequency`, `name` and `func`."

    "If you take a look at the columns of the dataframes above, you can see the names are the arguments in the `MeterReader` and `VariableReader` classes, and only `name` and `func` are missing. That means, you can add these columns to input the `name` and `func` arguments as desired. **The only limitation is that you cannot return time series in optimisation**. In case of the Output:Meter dataframe, we won't add the `name` and `func` columns, which means the name will be the `key_name` and hourly results will be aggregated using the pd.Series.sum() function. However, in case of the Output:Variable dataframe, we will specify these: we want the average rather than the sum, therefore we will pass the name bound to the function `average_results`, and we will add '_average' as a suffix to the `variable_name` column. We will also remove the outputs for BLOCK1:ZONE2, which are the rows 2 and 4."
