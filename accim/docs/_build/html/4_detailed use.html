<h2>4.1 First steps<a class="headerlink" href="#first-steps" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Four main branches of functions have been developed, which are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>VRF system with full air-conditioning mode: This mode has been
developed mainly to support models originated with OpenStudio, which
up to date does not support Airflow Network objects and subsequently
Calculated Natural Ventilation. It adds standard VRF systems for each
occupied zone and applies the adaptive or PMV-based setpoint
temperatures, but only works with full air-conditioning mode.</p></li>
<li><p>VRF system with mixed mode: It adds standard VRF systems for each
occupied zone and applies the adaptive or PMV-based setpoint
temperatures. Works with Calculated Natural Ventilation, although
full air-conditioning mode can also be used. If mixed mode is used,
the model must be generally developed with DesignBuilder.</p></li>
<li><p>Existing HVAC system only with full air-conditioning mode: Keeps the
existing HVAC systems and modify the existing setpoint temperatures
to adaptive or PMV-based setpoint temperatures. However, mixed-mode
and naturally ventilated modes are not available in this mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Existing HVAC system with mixed mode: UNDER DEVELOPMENT. IT IS NOT
ADVISABLE TO USE IT YET. Keeps the existing HVAC systems and modify
the existing setpoint temperatures to adaptive or PMV-based setpoint
temperatures, considering mixed-mode. In order to properly work,
there must be only one object for heating and another for cooling
that can be used to monitor if these are turned on at any timestep
(such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Coil:Cooling:Water</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Coil:Heating:Water</span></code>). Also,
these objects must be named following the pattern “Zone name” “Object
name”. For instance, an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Coil:Heating:Electric</span></code> object could be
named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Block1:Zone1</span> <span class="pre">PTAC</span> <span class="pre">Heating</span> <span class="pre">Coil</span></code>, given that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Block1:Zone1</span></code>
is a valid zone name. On the other hand, a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Coil:Cooling:Water</span></code>
object named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Main</span> <span class="pre">Cooling</span> <span class="pre">Coil</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code> would not be valid, since in
this case the room would be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Main</span></code>; this is the typical case of
some equipment shared by multiple rooms. If this condition is not
met, accim will not generate the output IDF files for that input IDF
file. For instance, if there are <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Coil:Heating:Electric</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed</span></code> objects in the same model, simulation
will crash. Also, if there is just an
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ZoneHVAC:Baseboard:RadiantConvective:Water</span></code> used for heating, and
cooling is not monitored, simulation will also crash.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, if you are going to use the VRF system script, you’re
supposed to have one or multiple IDFs with fixed setpoint temperature,
or even without any HVAC objects at all (it doesn’t matter, since the
module is going to add a standard VRF system for each zone, and the
simulation is going to be calculated with these VRF systems), and with
Calculated Natural Ventilation if you’re going to use the Mixed Mode. On
the other hand, if you are going to use any ExistingHVAC script, again
you’re supposed to have one or multiple IDFs, however in this case there
must be a fully functional HVAC system. Therefore, you must be able to
successfully run a simulation with fixed setpoint temperatures in order
for the accim package to work. The main difference between ExistingHVAC
only with full air-conditioning and with mixed mode is that in the
latter, the existing HVAC system needs to be mapped in order to monitor
if it needs to be activated or not, and windows need to be actuated in
case conditions for natural ventilation are favourable. In both cases,
when you export the IDF, please do not request ASHRAE 55 or CEN 15251
results. accim will do so by adding the relevant fields to the People
objects.</p>
<p>By using any ExistingHVAC script you might not get the results that you
expect, even if there are no errors in the accim and simulation
processes. The reason lies on the HVAC system itself, and that is why
the VRFsystem script has been developed, because it has been tested that
it works.</p>
<p>No matter what type or functions are you going to use, the language of
the software used to create the input IDF should be English (for
example, if you use Designbuilder in Spanish, accim won’t work
properly), and it’s not recommended to use any non-standard characters
in the input IDF, just like written accents or “ñ”.</p>
<p>Said that, accim will transform all the IDF files located in the same
path where script is. Therefore, the quickest way to run the script is
opening a prompt command dialog in the folder where the IDF files are
located (you can do this by holding Ctrl and right-click inside the
folder, and click on ‘open PowerShell window here’). Then run Python by
typing ‘python’ in the command prompt.</p>
<p>First you need to import the module ‘accis’ (stands for
Adaptive-Comfort-Control-Implementation Script):</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">accim.sim</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">accis</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And then, you just need to call the accis function:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">accis</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">addAccis</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then you’ll be asked in the prompt to enter some information so that
python knows how do you want to set up the output IDFs:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>--------------------------------------------------------
Adaptive-Comfort-Control-Implemented Model (ACCIM)
--------------------------------------------------------

This tool allows to apply adaptive setpoint temperatures.
For further information, please read the documentation:
https://accim.readthedocs.io/en/master/
For a visual understanding of the tool, please visit the following jupyter notebooks:
-    Using addAccis() to apply adaptive setpoint temperatures
https://github.com/dsanchez-garcia/accim/blob/master/accim/sample_files/jupyter_notebooks/addAccis/using_addAccis.ipynb
-    Using rename_epw_files() to rename the EPWs for proper data analysis after simulation
https://github.com/dsanchez-garcia/accim/blob/master/accim/sample_files/jupyter_notebooks/rename_epw_files/using_rename_epw_files.ipynb
-    Using runEp() to directly run simulations with EnergyPlus
https://github.com/dsanchez-garcia/accim/blob/master/accim/sample_files/jupyter_notebooks/runEp/using_runEp.ipynb
-    Using the class Table() for data analysis
https://github.com/dsanchez-garcia/accim/blob/master/accim/sample_files/jupyter_notebooks/Table/using_Table.ipynb

Now, you are going to be asked to enter some information for different arguments to generate the output IDFs with adaptive setpoint temperatures.
If you are not sure about how to use these parameters, please take a look at the documentation in the following link:
https://accim.readthedocs.io/en/master/4_detailed%20use.html

Please, enter the following information:

Enter the ScriptType (
for VRFsystem with full air-conditioning mode: vrf_ac;
for VRFsystem with mixed-mode: vrf_mm;
for ExistingHVAC with mixed mode: ex_mm;
for ExistingHVAC with full air-conditioning mode: ex_ac
): vrf_mm

Enter the SupplyAirTempInputMethod (
for Supply Air Temperature: supply air temperature;
for Temperature Difference: temperature difference;
): temperature difference

Do you want to keep the existing outputs (true or false)?: false

Enter the Output type (standard, simplified, detailed or custom): standard

Enter the Output frequencies separated by space (timestep, hourly, daily, monthly, runperiod): hourly runperiod

Do you want to generate a dataframe to see all outputs? (true or false): false

Enter the EnergyPlus version (9.1 to 23.1): 23.1

Enter the Temperature Control method (temperature or pmv): temperature
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>ScriptType can be ‘vrf_mm’, ‘vrf_ac’, ‘ex_mm’ or ‘ex_ac’, and it refers to the type of functions as explained above</p></li>
<li><p>SupplyAirTempInputMethod can be ‘supply air temperature’ or ‘temperature difference’, and it is the supply air temperature input method for the VRF systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Existing outputs in the IDF can be kept if entered ‘true’. Otherwise, if entered ‘false’, it will be removed for clarity purposes at results stage.</p></li>
<li><p>Output_type can be ‘standard’, ‘detailed’, ‘simplified’ or ‘custom’ and it refers to the simulation results: ‘standard’ means that results will contain the full selection relevant to accim;‘detailed’ is mainly used for testing the software tool; ‘simplified’ means that results are just going to be the hourly operative temperature and VRF consumption of each zone, mainly used when you need the results not to be heavy files, because you are going to run a lot of simulations and capacity is limited; and finally, ‘custom’ allows the user to specify the outputs to be kept or removed by entering them in the python console.</p></li>
<li><p>Output_freqs (Output frequencies) can be timestep, hourly, daily, monthly and/or runperiod, and these must be entered separated by space. It will add the specified output type (standard or simplified) in all entered frequencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, a pandas DataFrame instance can be created containing all Output:Variable objects. This allows the user to filter the DataFrame as needed, so that it only contains the needed Output:Variable objects, and then it can be entered in the argument <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Output_take_dataframe</span></code></p></li>
<li><p>EnergyPlus_version can be from ‘9.1’ to ‘23.1’. It is the version of EnergyPlus you have installed in your computer. If you enter ‘9.1’, accim will look for the E+9.1.0 IDD file in path “C:\EnergyPlusV9-1-0”.</p></li>
<li><p>Temperature Control method can be ‘temperature’ or ‘temp’, or ‘pmv’. If ‘temp’ is used, the setpoint will be the operative temperature, otherwise if ‘pmv’ is used, the setpoint will be the PMV index.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>accis will show on the prompt command dialog all the objects it adds,
and those that doesn’t need to be added because were already in the IDF,
and finally ask you to enter some values to set up the IDFs as you
desire. Please refer to the section titled ‘Setting up the target IDFs’.</p>
<p>Once you run the simulations, you might get some EnergyPlus warnings and
severe errors. This is something I’m currently working on.</p>

<p>If you have run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">accis.addAccis()</span></code>, you will be asked in the prompt to
enter a few more values separated by space to set up the desired IDFs.
However, you can also skip the command prompt process by running accis
directly including the arguments in the function, whose usage would be:</p>

<p>For clarity purposes, it’s recommended to specify the argument name as
well, as shown above. If you don’t specify all arguments, you’ll be ask
to enter them at the prompt command, and these values will be used
instead of those specified in the function call. Each argument is
explained below:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>ComfStand: refers to the thermal comfort standard or model to be
applied. Enter any number from 0 to 22 to select the comfort standard
or model to be used; you can see which model is each number in the
table below. For example, if you enter ‘0 1 2 3’, you’ll get IDFs for CTE,
EN16798-1, ASHRAE 55 and the local model developed by Rijal et al for
Japanese dwellings. If you don’t enter any number, it’ll ask you to
enter the numbers again.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>CAT: refers to the category of the thermal comfort model applied.
Most of the Comfort Standards work with 80 and 90% acceptability
levels, except the European EN 16798-1 (works with Categories 1, 2
and 3), the Chinese GB/T 50785 (works with categories 1 and 2), and
the India Model for Adaptive Comfort - Commercial (which works with
80, 85 and 90% acceptability levels). So, for example, if you are
going to use the EN16798-1 (ComfStand = 1), you can enter ‘1 2 3’ to
generate setpoint temperatures for Categories 1, 2 and 3. Or, if you
are going to use the IMAC Commercial in naturally ventilated mode
(ComfStand = 7), you can enter ‘80 85 90’ to generate setpoint
temperatures for these acceptability levels. All categories are
referenced in the <a class="reference external" href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dsanchez-garcia/accim/blob/master/accim/docs/html_files/full_setpoint_table.html">full list of setpoint
temperatures</a>
at the end of this section. Please note that the Category values must
be consistent with the Comfort Standard values previously entered.
If, for instance, you enter ‘1’ in the Comfort Standard value (means
you’re asking for EN16798 model), but then enter ‘80’ or ‘90’ in the
Category value (which are categories used in ASHRAE55), you won’t get
the results you want.</p></li>
<li><p>ComfMod: is the Comfort Mode, and refers to the setpoint behaviour.
It controls if the setpoints are static (when ComfMod = 0 or 0.X) or
adaptive (when ComfMod = 1 or 1.X, 2 or 3). When they are adaptive, it also
controls the comfort model applied when the adaptive model is not
applicable (that is, when the running mean outdoor temperature limits
are exceeded), in which case a PMV-based model is applied. Each
ComfMod for each ComfStand and CAT is referenced at the <a class="reference external" href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dsanchez-garcia/accim/blob/master/accim/docs/html_files/full_setpoint_table.html">full list of
setpoint
temperatures</a>.
Please refer to the research article
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/8/1498">https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/8/1498</a> for more information. Figure
below shows the variation of setpoint temperatures when ComfMod 0
(upper left), 1 (upper right), 2 (lower left) and 3 (lower right),
when ComfStand is 1 (EN 16798-1, although figure shows the superseded
standard, but the setpoint behaviour is similar)</p></li>

</figure>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>SetpointAcc: refers to the accuracy of the setpoint temperatures. Any
number, integer or float, can be entered in this argument. For
instance, if 1 was entered, the cooling setpoint would be rounded to
the nearest integer below adaptive upper comfort limit minus
tolerance (ASTtol), and the heating setpoint would be rounded to the
nearest integer above adaptive lower comfort limit plus tolerance. If
27.46 and 20.46 were the upper and lower comfort limits and its
tolerances were respectively -0.1 and +0.1, then the nearest integers
to 27.36 and 20.56 would be 27 and 21, and therefore, these would be
the cooling and heating setpoint temperatures. If 2 was used instead,
then the rounding would be done to the nearest half. If 10 were used,
the rounding would be done to the first decimal. If 0.5 or 0.1 were
used, the rounding would be done respectively every 2 or 10 celsius
degrees.</p></li>
<li><p>CoolSeasonStart: it is the start of the cooling season, only used
when EN16798-1, ASHRAE 55 or ISO7730 are entered in ComfStand
(respectively, ComfStand = 1, 2 and 22) and setpoint behaviour is set
to static (i.e. ComfMod = 0). This argument can take the number of
the day in the year (i.e. an integer) or a string containing a date
in format dd/mm (for instance, “01/05”). Values of CoolSeasonStart
greater than CoolSeasonEnd can be used, therefore denoting the
location of the EPW file should be in the south hemisphere.</p></li>
<li><p>CoolSeasonEnd: Similar to CoolSeasonStart, but it is the end of the
cooling season. Again, only used when EN16798-1, ASHRAE 55 or ISO7730
are entered in ComfStand (respectively, ComfStand = 1, 2 and 22) and
setpoint behaviour is set to static (i.e. ComfMod = 0). Again, this
argument can take the number of the day in the year (i.e. an integer)
or a string containing a date in format dd/mm (for instance,
“01/05”). Values of CoolSeasonEnd smaller than CoolSeasonStart can be
used, therefore denoting the location of the EPW file should be in
the south hemisphere.</p></li>
<li><p>HVACmode: refers to the HVAC mode applied. Enter 0 for Fully
Air-conditioned (AC), 1 for Naturally ventilated (NV) and/or 2 for
Mixed Mode (MM). Please note that Calculated natural ventilation must
be enabled so that Mixed Mode works. So, for example, if you enter ‘0
1 2’ you’ll be getting all HVAC modes, or if you just enter ‘0 1’
you’ll be getting just Fully Air-conditioned and Naturally
ventilated.</p></li>
<li><p>VentCtrl: refers to the ventilation control, only used in for NV and
MM. When using NV, If you enter ‘0’, ventilation will be allowed if
operative temperature exceeds neutral temperature (also known as
comfort temperature); if you enter ‘1’, ventilation will be allowed
if operative temperature exceeds the upper comfort limit. In other
words, sets the value of the neutral temperature or the upper comfort
limit to the Ventilation Setpoint Temperature (VST). When using MM, 0
= Ventilates above neutral temperature and fully opens doors and
windows; 1 = Ventilates above lower comfort limit and fully opens
doors and windows; 2 = Ventilates above neutral temperature and opens
doors and windows based on the customised venting opening factor; and
3 = Ventilates above lower comfort limit and opens doors and windows
based on the customised venting opening factor. Either way, if you
enter ‘0 1’ you’ll be getting both ventilation control modes.</p></li>
<li><p>MaxTempDiffVOF: Maximum Temperature Difference for Venting Opening
Factor. Maximum temperature difference between indoor operative and
outdoor temperatures, which when exceeded, windows and doors are
opened only the fraction specified in the MultiplierVOF argument. If
temperature difference oscillates between maximum and minimum, the
windows and doors are opened based on the linear equation. Follows
the same operation as explained in <a class="reference external" href="https://designbuilder.co.uk/helpv7.0/Content/CalculatedNatVent.htm">Designbuilder help
website</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>MinTempDiffVOF: Minimum Temperature Difference for Venting Opening
Factor. Minimum temperature difference between indoor operative and
outdoor temperatures, which when smaller, windows and doors are fully
opened. If temperature difference oscillates between maximum and
minimum, the windows and doors are opened based on the linear
equation. Follows the same operation as explained in <a class="reference external" href="https://designbuilder.co.uk/helpv7.0/Content/CalculatedNatVent.htm">Designbuilder
help
website</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>MultiplierVOF: Multiplier for modulating the Venting Opening Factor.
The fraction of the windows that will be opened when temperature
difference exceeds MaxTempDiffVOF. Follows the same operation as
explained in <a class="reference external" href="https://designbuilder.co.uk/helpv7.0/Content/CalculatedNatVent.htm">Designbuilder help
website</a>.
<img alt="Venting Opening Factor" src="_images/VentingOpeningFactor.png" /></p></li>
<li><p>VSToffset: stands for Ventilation Setpoint Temperature (VST) offset,
again only used in Mixed Mode (HVAC Mode ‘2’). Applies the entered
values as an offset to the VST, in Celsius degrees. Values entered
can be positive or negative float or integers, and must be
space-separated. For example, if you enter ‘-2 -1 0 1 2’ you’ll be
getting offsets of -2°C, -1°C, 0°C, 1°C and 2°C to the VST. If you
don’t enter any number, it’ll be used ‘0’ as the default value.</p></li>
<li><p>MinOToffset: stands for Minimum Outdoor Temperature offset, again
only used in Mixed Mode (HVAC Mode ‘2’). Sets the minimum outdoor
temperature an offset to the heating setpoint temperature. For
example, if you enter ‘1’ (please, note that the numbers must be
positive), ventilation won’t be allowed if outdoor temperature falls
below 1°C below the heating setpoint, in order to prevent from
entering excessive cold. Therefore, below said limit, windows are
closed and, if needed, air conditioning starts to work. Entered
values can be float or integers, but always positive numbers, and
must be space-separated. For example, if you enter ‘0 1 2’ you’ll be
getting offsets of 0°C, 1°C and 2°C to the heating setpoint
temperature. If you don’t enter any number, it’ll be used ‘50’ as the
default value (that is 50°C below heating setpoint temperature, and
therefore no limit is applied).</p></li>
<li><p>MaxWindSpeed: stands for maximum wind speed, again only used in Mixed
Mode (HVAC Mode ‘2’). Sets the maximum wind speed in which
ventilation is allowed, in m/s. Therefore, if you enter ‘20’,
ventilation won’t be allowed if wind speed is greater than 20 m/s.
Entered values can be float or integers, but always positive numbers,
and must be space-separated. For example, if you enter ‘5 10 15 20’
you’ll be getting different IDFs with maximum wind speeds of 5 m/s,
10 m/s, 15 m/s and 20 m/s. If you don’t enter any number, it’ll be
used ‘50’ as the default value (that is 50 m/s, and therefore no
limit is applied).</p></li>
<li><p>ASTtol: stands for Adaptive Setpoint Temperature tolerance. It
applies the number that you enter as a tolerance for the adaptive
heating and cooling setpoint temperatures. The original problem was
that, if we assigned the adaptive setpoint straight to the comfort
limit (i.e. you enter ‘0’ for ASTtol), there were a few hours that
fell outside the comfort zone because of the error in some decimals
in the simulation of the operative temperature. Therefore, the
original purpose of this feature is to control that all hours are
comfortable hours (i.e. operative temperature falls within the
comfort zone), and we can make that sure by considering a little
tolerance of 0.10 °C. For example, say that adaptive cooling and
heating setpoints are originally 29.5 and 21.5°C at some day; if you
enter ‘1’ for ASTtol, then the setpoints would be modified to 28.5
and 22.5°C (1°C below original cooling setpoint, and 1°C above
original heating setpoint). The function will create a sequence of
numbers based on the entered values. So, numbers must be entered in 3
stages: first, the start of the sequence; second, the end of the
sequence, and third, the steps. So for example, if you enter ‘0’ for
the start, ‘1’ for the end, and ‘0.25’ for the steps, you would be
getting ASTtol values of 0°C, 0.25°C, 0.5°C, 0.75°C and 1°C. If you
don’t enter any number, it’ll be used ‘0.1’ as the default value (as
previously said, to make sure all hours are comfortable hours), and
you would be getting only one variation of 0.1°C.</p></li>
<li><p>NameSuffix: the text you would like to add at the end of the file
name.</p></li>
<li><p>verboseMode: True to print all process in screen, False to not to
print it. Default is True.</p></li>
<li><p>confirmGen: Generally, this argument should be left as default. True
to confirm automatically the generation of IDFs; if False, you’ll be
asked to confirm in command prompt. Default is False. So, if you are
going to set it True, be sure about the number of IDFs you are going
to generate, because these might be thousands.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, below you can see a sample name of an IDF created by using accim’s
VRFsystem functions. The package takes the original IDF file as a
reference, saves a copy, run all the functions so that setpoint
temperatures are transformed from static to adaptive, an changes its
name based on the values previously entered:</p>
<p><strong>TestModel_onlyGeometryForVRFsystem[CS_INT
EN16798[CA_1[CM_3[HM_2[VC_0[VO_0.0[MT_50.0[MW_50.0[AT_0.1[standard</strong></p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>‘TestModel_onlyGeometryForVRFsystem’ is the name of the original IDF.</p></li>
<li><p>CS refers to the Comfort Standard, and it’s followed by the thermal
comfort standard applied (could be ‘ESP CTE’, ‘INT EN16798’, ‘INT
ASHRAE55’, ‘JPN Rijal’, etc).</p></li>
<li><p>CA refers to the Category, which could be 1, 2 or 3 if CS is EN16798,
80 or 90 if CS is ASHRAE55 or other models, or 80, 85 or 90 in case
of the IMAC C.</p></li>
<li><p>CM refers to the Comfort Mode, which could be 0 (Static), 1, 2, or 3
(Adaptive modes).</p></li>
<li><p>HM refers to the HVAC Mode, which could be 0 (Full air conditioning),
1 (Naturally ventilated), or 2 (Mixed Mode).</p></li>
<li><p>VC refers to the Ventilation Control, which could be 0, 1, 2 or 3.</p></li>
<li><p>VO refers to the Ventilation setpoint temperature offset, which could
be any number, float or integer, positive or negative.</p></li>
<li><p>MT refers to the Minimum Outdoor Temperature offset, which could be
any number, float or integer, but always positive number.</p></li>
<li><p>MW refers to the Maximum Wind Speed, which could be any number, float
or integer, but always positive number.</p></li>
<li><p>AT refers to the Adaptive Setpoint Temperature offset, which could be
any number, float or integer, but always positive number. Please
remember this number comes from a 3-stage process (refer to the
explanation above).</p></li>
<li><p>‘standard’ is the suffix, which can be whatever you want. For
example, this allows you to make a for loop with ‘standard’,
‘simplified’ and ‘timestep’ and run the simulations with all type of
outputs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If some inputs are not used or don’t make sense, you’ll be able to se an
‘X’ in the output IDF file. For example, if you use CTE as Comfort
Standard, then the inputs for Category and Comfort Mode (which are only
for EN16798-1 and ASHRAE 55) are not used in the process, and the output
IDF would contain in its name ‘CS_ESP CTE[CA_X[CM_X’. Another similar
case occurs if you use Full air-conditioning HVAC Mode (i.e. enter ‘0’
for HVAC Mode), or if you use the ‘ex_ac’ ScriptType, where the output
IDF would contain in its name ‘[HM_0[VC_X[VO_X[MT_X[MW_X’.</p>

<h2>4.4 Putting it into practice: Adaptive setpoint temperatures step by step<a class="headerlink" href="#putting-it-into-practice-adaptive-setpoint-temperatures-step-by-step" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>You can see a Jupyter Notebook either in the How-to Guide section of this documentation or in the link below:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dsanchez-garcia/accim/blob/master/accim/sample_files/jupyter_notebooks/addAccis/using_addAccis.ipynb">https://github.com/dsanchez-garcia/accim/blob/master/accim/sample_files/jupyter_notebooks/addAccis/using_addAccis.ipynb</a></p>
<p>You can also execute it at your computer. You just need to find the folder containing the .ipynb and all other files at the accim package folder
within your site_packages path, in</p>
<p>accim/sample_files/jupyter_notebooks/addAccis</p>
<p>The path should be something like this, with your username instead of
YOUR_USERNAME:</p>
<p><em>C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Lib\site-packages\accim\sample_files\jupyter_notebooks\addAccis</em></p>
<p>Then, you just need to copy the folder to a different path (i.e. Desktop), open a cmd dialog pointing at it, and run “jupyter notebook”. After that, an internet browser will pop up, and you will be able to open the .ipynb file.</p>
<p>You can also see an example below. The input file is included within
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">accim/sample_files/sample</span> <span class="pre">IDFs</span></code> folder, and it was originally named
<code class="file docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TestModel_onlyGeometryForVRFsystem_2zones_CalcVent_V2310.idf</span></code>, but for
clarity purposes in this case has been renamed to “TestModel.idf”.</p>
<p>So, say you have an IDF in some folder, called ‘TestModel.idf’. So, you
can either open an IDE or simply a CMD dialog pointing at that path and
execute python. Let’s run the functions to get the energy models with
adaptive setpoint temperatures.</p>

<p>If we entered <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">n</span></code>, the whole process would shut down. Otherwise, if we
entered ‘y’, the generation of output IDF files would start, and ACCIS
would print on screen each output IDF name as it generates it. As you
can see, we are going to use the EN16798-1, ASHRAE 55 and IMAC
Commercial for naturally ventilated buildings, categories 2 and 3 for
EN16798, 90% acceptability levels for ASHRAE 55, 85 and 90%
acceptability levels for IMAC C NV, all with ComfMod 0 (with static
setpoint temperatures) and 3 (with adaptive setpoint temperatures when
the model is applicable, otherwise horizontally extending the adaptive
setpoint temperatures), Mixed Mode, and we just went ahead with the
remaining default values.</p>

any simulation, including the hourly results on a CSV file.</p>

<p>This script has been created by eppy’s development team
(<a class="reference external" href="https://eppy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/runningeplus.html">https://eppy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/runningeplus.html</a>, specifically
from section ‘Running in parallel processes using Generators’), however
I did some changes. Anyway, you probably should check out eppy package,
since it’s absolutely awesome.</p>
<p>By using this script, the EnergyPlus version used to simulate the IDFs
will be the IDF’s version. Therefore, if your IDF is in version 9.4, but
you don’t have EnergyPlus 9.4 installed, you’ll get an error.</p>
<p>The main difference is that this one allows to run simulations with
several EPW files. It takes all EPW files and IDF files located in the
script folder, and runs them. So for example, say you have 2 no. IDFs
(1.idf and 2.idf) and 2 no. EPW files (a.epw and b.epw). Then, this
script will run the following simulations: 1[a; 1[b; 2[a; 2[b. The
character ‘[’ has been used as separator in order to not to be in
conflict with other programs. Besides, there’s a package within accim
currently being developed (within folder data) in order to generate
tables and graphs automatically.</p>
<p>So, how to use it?</p>
<p>Say you have already run any of the accis functions, and therefore you
might have a folder with the following files:</p>

<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">runEp()</span></code> is going to ask you if you want to run the simulations only
with IDF files generated by accim. If you enter ‘y’, it’ll run only
accim output IDFs, otherwise if you enter ‘n’, it will run all idfs in
the folder. As you can see below, we didn’t need to remove the original
IDF ‘TestModel_SingleZone.idf’ from the folder. Then, it will let you
know the IDFs and EPWs that are going to be used in the simulations.
Besides, it’ll let you know the total number of simulations, and will
ask for your confirmation, because you might start thousands of
simulations by mistake. Further, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">runEp()</span></code>can take a total number of
3 arguments, which are 2 boolean arguments, and one integer:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">runEp(runOnlyAccim=True,</span> <span class="pre">confirmRun=True,</span> <span class="pre">num_CPUs=4)</span></code>. If you
entered these, you would skip the command prompt process and jump
straight to the simulation process. Since we entered 4 for the num_CPUs
argument, the simulations would be run by using 4 CPS at the same time.</p>

<p>You might need to keep these in order to debug some error, or any other
reason, but if you don’t need to keep these except csv values with
hourly results, you can run the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">removefiles()</span></code> function:</p>

<p>You can see a Jupyter Notebook either in the How-to Guide section of this documentation or in the link below:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dsanchez-garcia/accim/blob/master/accim/sample_files/jupyter_notebooks/runEp/using_runEp.ipynb">https://github.com/dsanchez-garcia/accim/blob/master/accim/sample_files/jupyter_notebooks/Table/using_Table.ipynb</a></p>
<p>You can also execute it at your computer. You just need to find the folder containing the .ipynb and all other files at the accim package folder
within your site_packages path, in</p>
<p>accim/sample_files/jupyter_notebooks/Table</p>
<p>The path should be something like this, with your username instead of
