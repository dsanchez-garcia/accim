# TODO

Active short-term tasks.

## Conventions

- Use priorities: `P0` (critical), `P1` (high), `P2` (normal).
- Use status tags: `todo`, `in progress`, `blocked`.
- Reference issue/PR links when available.
- When a task is completed, move the outcome to `DEVLOG.md`.

## Task template

## Backlog

- [ ] [P1][todo] Define backlog priority rules
  - Context: Standardize entry criteria for new tasks.
  - Definition of done: A short guideline with approved P0/P1/P2 criteria.
  - References: N/A

- [ ] [P2][todo] Agree on issue and PR link format
  - Context: Avoid mixed linking styles in technical tracking files.
  - Definition of done: One convention applied in `DEVLOG.md`, `TODO.md`, and `ROADMAP.md`.
  - References: N/A

- [ ] [P1][todo] Add regression tests for multi-IDF floor-area normalization mapping
  - Context: Validate `normalize_outputs(...)` with `building_floor_area` dictionaries across multiple IDFs in post-processing outputs.
  - Definition of done: Tests verify correct per-IDF divisors and fail on missing/incorrect IDF-area mapping assumptions.
  - References: `accim/parametric_and_optimisation/analysis.py`, `tests/parametric_and_optimisation/10_test_outputs_preflight.py`

- [ ] [P1][todo] Add regression tests for normalized-unit consistency across aggregation frequencies
  - Context: Ensure normalized outputs remain coherent when moving from hourly to daily/monthly/runperiod aggregations.
  - Definition of done: Tests validate expected normalized column naming and numeric consistency after aggregation.
  - References: `accim/parametric_and_optimisation/main.py`, `accim/parametric_and_optimisation/analysis.py`

- [ ] [P1][todo] Add resilience tests for missing CSV outputs after cleanup policies
  - Context: Post-processing should fail with clear diagnostics when required simulation CSV artifacts were removed by storage policies.
  - Definition of done: Tests cover missing file paths and assert actionable error messages in hourly/output retrieval methods.
  - References: `accim/parametric_and_optimisation/main.py`, `tests/parametric_and_optimisation/test_sim_file_cleanup.py`

- [ ] [P2][todo] Review the branch `refactor/sim-v1` and decide what to bring to `master`
  - Context: `refactor/sim-v1` holds the old refactoring towards accim 1.0 (the "1.0.0 clean-break release": new API, modernised docstrings, documentation and notebooks, more tests, and the code review of 2026-07-19), with 36 commits from 2026-05-27 to 2026-07-19 and about 118 files changed. Development went on with 0.7.x in `master` instead (69 commits since the two split at `c03250f`), so the branch was never merged. It was kept on purpose on 2026-10-17, when the other branches were merged into `master` and deleted.
  - Definition of done: each change of the branch checked against the current `master` and marked as port, adapt or drop; the useful parts brought in small PRs with their tests; then the branch deleted.
  - References: `origin/refactor/sim-v1`; `git log c03250f..origin/refactor/sim-v1`; the CHANGELOG of that branch (1.0.0 entry).

- [ ] [P2][todo] Add schema-heterogeneity tests for split-by grouped outputs
  - Context: Contract is to keep realistic per-group schemas when `drop_all_empty_output_columns=True`.
  - Definition of done: Tests assert different output-column sets across groups and downstream handling expectations.
  - References: `accim/parametric_and_optimisation/main.py`, `tests/parametric_and_optimisation/10_test_outputs_preflight.py`
