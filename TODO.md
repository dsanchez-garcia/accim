# TODO

Active short-term tasks.

## Conventions

- Use priorities: `P0` (critical), `P1` (high), `P2` (normal).
- Use status tags: `todo`, `in progress`, `blocked`.
- Reference issue/PR links when available.
- When a task is completed, move the outcome to `DEVLOG.md`.

## Backlog

- [ ] [P2][blocked] A5: the clothing insulation as a function of the outdoor temperature
  - Context: A5 is done (2026-11-09, `DEVLOG.md`): the activity level and the clothing insulation by season and `'dynamic_ashrae55'` in `set_pmv_input_parameters`, as the prompt of the proposal asks, and `accim.sim.people.set_clothing_method`, with the `schedule` that the author chose (`notes/decisions.md`). The design of the proposal also has the clothing insulation as a function of the outdoor temperature (`callable(rmot) -> clo`), written as a `Schedule:File` from the EPW "vía E1" (`compute_setpoints`, not implemented) or as Erl by sections. Blocked on E1, a proposal that the author has not asked for.
  - Definition of done: as the author decides, with tests, documentation and `CHANGELOG.md`.
  - References: `notes/PROPUESTAS_MEJORAS_post_1.1.0_v02.md` (A5 and E1), `CAMBIOS_CODIGO_v1.2.0.md` §4.

- [ ] [P1][blocked] Define backlog priority rules
  - Context: Standardize entry criteria for new tasks. Blocked on the approval of the author.
  - Proposal (2026-10-31): `P0`: it stops users or a release now (a crash or wrong results in a published version, lost data, a security problem); it goes before anything else. `P1`: needed for the next release, or wrong behaviour that has a workaround, failing tests, or documentation that misleads. `P2`: improvements, refactors, reviews and tasks without a date. When in doubt, the lower priority; raise it when a user is affected.
  - Definition of done: A short guideline with approved P0/P1/P2 criteria (once approved, in the Conventions of this file).
  - References: N/A

- [ ] [P2][blocked] Agree on issue and PR link format
  - Context: Avoid mixed linking styles in technical tracking files. Blocked on the approval of the author.
  - Proposal (2026-10-31): `#123` for the issues and pull requests of this repository and `owner/repo#123` for those of other repositories (for instance, `NREL/EnergyPlus#11409`), which GitHub links in both cases; full URLs only for other sites. `DEVLOG.md` already uses `#N` for this repository; applying it means changing "EnergyPlus pull request 11409" (and 11551) in `DEVLOG.md` and `TODO.md`.
  - Definition of done: One convention applied in `DEVLOG.md`, `TODO.md`, and `ROADMAP.md`.
  - References: N/A
